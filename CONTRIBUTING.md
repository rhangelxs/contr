## Code of Conduct

To be 

### Project Conventions
There are a few conventions that have developed over time. As of 2017 projects consists up to four parts: report, dataset, script and presentation.
Content of the parts located below. Suggested file structure provided in special section - file structure.

* **Report** file are typically describe experimental design and details of realization of the research project.
	* Basically it is text file, but you can include any support materials if it is needed.
	* Try not to add too much though, but stay clear and add all needed explanations here.
* **Dataset** that include all original data
	* Check that you reporting your data in raw format (not in aggregated form)
	* Check column names
	* Fit to your variables
	* Units for every variable is clear
	* Often numerical data should be machine readable
* **Script** file contains analysis and results of checking you assumptions.
	* Script can be published in two types: original code or compiled one.  To see the output of original code we need a special program. Compiled version is human readable and published in exchangeable formats like HTML, Markdown or others.
	> Note. Jypyther Notebook contains both code and output, so it might be upload as is.
	* Please, always include compiled version of your script. Compiled or human readable means any output of your script (even in txt). Because nobody have have the same libraries as yours on they machines.
	* You can include both versions (included the original one), if prefer.
* **Presentation** is essential results that you get.
	* Printable version of you presentation is the best option to publish.

Design Decisions
You should make a significant decision what and how you will publish and maintain the project files and what we can or cannot publish, we will document it in this file atom/design-decisions repository. If you have a question around how we do things, check to see if it is documented here. If it is not documented there, please ask your question.

File structure
File structure is important. The two main variants are available:
1. Using same common name for all parts of a project. It could be name of project in short form.
In this case filenames will looks like: for report project_x.docx, presentation - project_x.pdf, project_x.csv for dataset.
> Note Please don't use this pattern if name of root folder already contains project name. In this case use unique filenames described below.
2. Using unique file names for specific part of your project. In this case special requirement applied.
Report should be named  project_description . Dataset: dataset or data.  Presentation should named literally presentation. But all formats of script (original one and output or compiled one) should have the same name like  script.Rmd, script.html, etc.
Of course, all files should have a valid extension according to the filetypes.


Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Atom. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> Note:* If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

Before Submitting A Bug Report

* *Check the debugging guide.* You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of Atom, if the problem happens when you run Atom in safe mode, and if you can get the desired behavior by changing Atom's or packages' config settings.
* *Check the FAQs on the forum* for a list of common questions and problems.
* *Determine which repository the problem should be reported in*.
* *Perform a cursory search* to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Atom, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Atom otherwise. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Atom command, and if so which one?
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, *record the GIF with the Keybinding Resolver shown*. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux.
* If you're reporting that Atom crashed, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. On macOS, the crash report will be available in Console.app under "Diagnostic and usage information" > "User diagnostic reports". Include the crash report in the issue in a code block, a file attachment, or put it in a gist and provide link to that gist.
* If the problem is related to performance or memory, include a CPU profile capture with your report.
* If Chrome's developer tools pane is shown without you triggering it, that normally means that you have a syntax error in one of your themes or in your styles.less. Try running in Safe Mode and using a different theme or comment out the contents of your styles.less to see if that fixes the problem.
* If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* *Can you reproduce the problem in safe mode?*
* Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating to a new version of Atom) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Atom? What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Atom from the releases page.
* Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some? Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* Which version of Atom are you using? You can get the exact version by running atom -v in your terminal, or by starting Atom and running the Application: About command from the Command Palette.
* What's the name and version of the OS you're using?
* Are you running Atom in a virtual machine? If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
* *Which packages do you have installed?* You can get that list by running apm list --installed.
* *Are you using local configuration files* config.cson, keymap.cson, snippets.cson, styles.less and init.coffee to customize Atom? If so, provide the contents of those files, preferably in a code block or with a link to a gist.
* Are you using Atom with multiple monitors? If so, can you reproduce the problem when you use a single monitor?
* Which keyboard layout are you using? Are you using a US layout or some other layout?

Suggesting Enhancements
This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Atom, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in the template, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* *Check the debugging guide* for tips — you might discover that the enhancement is already available. Most importantly, check if you're using the latest version of Atom and if you can get the desired behavior by changing Atom's or packages' config settings.
* *Check if there's already a package which provides that enhancement.*
* *Determine which repository the enhancement should be suggested in.*
* *Perform a cursory search* to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
* Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Atom which the suggestion is related to. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux.
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Atom users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a community package.
* List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists.
* Specify which version of Atom you're using. You can get the exact version by running atom -v in your terminal, or by starting Atom and running the Application: About command from the Command Palette.
* Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.

Your First Code Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

* Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

If you want to read about using Atom or developing packages in Atom, the Atom Flight Manual is free and available online. You can find the source to the manual in atom/flight-manual.atom.io.

 Use this:
export default class ClassName {



}

// Instead of:
class ClassName {

}
export default ClassName


CoffeeScript Styleguide

* Set parameter defaults without spaces around the equal sign
  * clear = (count=1) -> instead of clear = (count = 1) ->
* Use spaces around operators
  * count + 1 instead of count+1
* Use spaces after commas (unless separated by newlines)
* Use parentheses if it improves code clarity.
* Prefer alphabetic keywords to symbolic keywords:
  * a is b instead of a == b
* Avoid spaces inside the curly-braces of hash literals:
  * {a: 1, b: 2} instead of { a: 1, b: 2 }
* Include a single line of whitespace between methods.
* Capitalize initialisms and acronyms in names, except for the first word, which
should be lower-case:
* getURI instead of getUri
* uriToOpen instead of URIToOpen
* Use slice() to copy an array
* Add an explicit return when your function ends with a for/while loop and
you don't want it to return a collected array.
* Use this instead of a standalone @
* return this instead of return @

Specs Styleguide

- Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured Jasmine specs in the ./spec folder.
- Treat describe as a noun or situation.
- Treat it as a statement about state or how an operation changes state.

Example


describe 'a dog', ->
it 'barks', ->
# spec here
describe 'when the dog is happy', ->
it 'wags its tail', ->
# spec here


Documentation Styleguide

* Use AtomDoc.
* Use Markdown.
* Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom {} notation:
	* Reference classes with {ClassName}
	* Reference instance methods with {ClassName::methodName}
	* Reference class methods with {ClassName.methodName}

Example


# Public: Disable the package with the given name.
#
# * `name`    The {String} name of the package to disable.
# * `options` (optional) The {Object} with disable options (default: {}):
#   * `trackTime`     A {Boolean}, `true` to track the amount of time taken.
#   * `ignoreErrors`  A {Boolean}, `true` to catch and ignore errors thrown.
# * `callback` The {Function} to call after the package has been disabled.
#
# Returns `undefined`.
disablePackage: (name, options, callback) ->


Additional Notes

Issue and Pull Request Labels
This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. Most labels are used across all Atom repositories, but some are specific to atom/atom.

GitHub search makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. For example, you might be interested in open issues across atom/atom and all Atom-owned packages which are labeled as bugs, but still need to be reliably reproduced or perhaps open pull requests in atom/atom which haven't been reviewed yet. To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed with search links for finding open items with that label in atom/atom only and also across all Atom repositories. We  encourage you to read about other search filters which will help you write more focused queries.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

Please open an issue on atom/atom if you have suggestions for new labels, and if you notice some labels are missing on some repositories, then please open an issue on that repository.
